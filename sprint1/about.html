            Welcome to my blog!
        </h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            Hey there, my name is Marius! I'm from Lithuania and currently I'm a student at the Baltic Institute of Technology studying Full Stack. Prior to these courses, I was in the military for approximately eight and a half years. The IT sector had been on my mind for a long time, probably for too long, so I decided to make a move. It was hard in the beginning, but leaving the military and chasing my dream felt like a fresh wind for my mind.
    </p>
        <p>
            This blog was created as a first project for a grade while I'm studying Full stack here in Lithuania. At first I did not take it as a serious thing, but then I thought I'm going to make it as real as I can, and who knows, maybe I will start writing about it.<br/>
            Prior to these studies, I attempted to learn front-end from sites such as SoloLearn, YouTube tutorials, and freecodecamp.org. I know it sounds great, but it wasn't like that in reality. The progress was slow because I was working on two different jobs and had to find at least some time for my family, especially my little one. It was hard to do so. I had to choose my priorities, and most of the time it had to be work, so I was not happy about that. I wanted more free time, flexible hours, to create some kind of product others could see, to be able to work from home and, of course, to be able to earn more.<br/>
            So I decided I needed a change. Every time I had an opportunity, I took my laptop out of my backpack and started learning, but IT is a whole different sector than the military, so my brain was boiling-like for real! It was like that because I hadn't done anything like that for years, so my brain needed to adapt. After some time, I got more knowledge about the Front-end, mostly HTML and CSS, but progress has stopped. I was stuck on tutorials, thinking "I'm not ready yet, I don't know everything yet." Because of that, it was hard to try writing code by myself, so I stopped. I needed time to think and come up with a plan since I've made the decision that I'm going to leave the military for better. I started searching and found courses that had to start in like a month and a half. I even had an opportunity to get funded, so I took the opportunity and here I am. Now that I'm not working, I'm able to devote more time to my studies.<br/>
            So I hope you already understand that this blog is for you - yes, you who are struggling there. I know you will break out of these chains that are holding you. It doesn't matter what kind of chains those are.<br/>
            Positive vibes only.
